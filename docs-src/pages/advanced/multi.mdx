## Making Multiple Selections without Graphql

Using the Models through a GQL schema will automatically inline and combine relations. To get the same functionality, when manually using `query` outside of GQL, you will need to return a dataclass from `select` with all the data you want to return.

```python
import dataclasses


@dataclasses.dataclass
class R:
    author: Author
    book: Book


# Query author and book at the same time.
q = query(conn, Book).select(lambda book: R(book=book, author=book.author()))
result: list[R] = await q.as_list()
```

Dataclasses are used instead of Tuples because there is no Tuple type in GQL.
