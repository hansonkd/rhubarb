# Migrations

Rhubarb has basic support for migrations. It will watch for new, changed columns and tables.

## Migration Commands
Make migrations with:

```bash
python -m rhubarb.migrations.cmd.make
```

Apply migrations with

```bash
python -m rhubarb.migrations.cmd.apply
```

Drop all Tables

```bash
python -m rhubarb.migrations.cmd.reset
```

## Migration Basics

You can manage migrations with Registries. A registry is a group of models that can include other registries. This allows you include apps with collections of models in your app.

By default there is a DEFAULT_REGISTRY that all models will be associated with unless otherwise specified. In general if you are creating your models that will run as your main app, you can use `DEFAULT_REGISTRY`, but the options are there to customize. If you do want to use a different registry as your main registry of your app, set `Config.registry`

```python
from rhubarb import DEFAULT_REGISTRY, Registry, BaseModel, table

# You can link other registries to your registry, this is useful for other plugins or libs.
DEFAULT_REGISTRY.link(third_party_registry)


# Go to default registry
@table
class SomeTable(BaseModel):
    pass

# Go to your specific registry
@table(registry=registry)
class MyTable(BaseModel):
    pass


# Don't include in migrations...
@table(skip_registry=True)
class OtherTable(BaseModel):
    pass
```


## Indexes and Constraints

Indexes and constraints are returned with the `__indexes__` and `__constraints__` function. Rhubarb will monitor if these change by their key and generate migrations if needed.

```python
from rhubarb import BaseModel, column, table, Index, Constraint
from rhubarb.functions import concat


@table
class Person(BaseModel):
    first_name: str = column()
    last_name: str = column()
    favorite_number: int = column()
    least_favorite_number: int = column()

    def __indexes__(self):
        return {
            "by_last_name_comma_first": Index(
                on=concat(self.last_name, ",", self.first_name)
            ),
            "by_favorite_number": Index(
                on=self.favorite_number
            )
        }

    def __constraints__(self):
        return {
            "favorite_ne_least_favorite": Constraint(
                check=self.favorite_number != self.least_favorite_number
            )
        }
```

You can add a `DEFAULT` to a column with `sql_default`. Only some SQL functions are supported in order to preserve serialization functionality with Migrations for now.

```python
import uuid
import datetime
from rhubarb import BaseModel, column, table, BUILTINS


@table
class AwesomeTable(BaseModel):
    some_uuid: uuid.UUID = column(sql_default=BUILTINS.UUID_GENERATE_V4)
    some_datetime: datetime.datetime = column(sql_default=BUILTINS.NOW)
```


## Running Python in Migrations

If you want to run a data migration and you need to run python, then generate migrations with `--empty`, and add  `RunPython` to the operations list.

```bash
python -m rhubarb.migrations.cmd.make --empty
```
With RunPython, you get a snapshot of table instances with only concrete fields (no virtual columns or relationships). If you need a computation, redefine it inside the migration so that when you code changes, your migration will always stay the same.

```python
from rhubarb import migrations
from rhubarb import query, save, table, virtual_column, relation, update


async def mig_fn(info: migrations.MigrationInfo):
    RatingModel = info.get_model("ratingmodel")
    ReviewerModel = info.get_model("reviewermodel")

    # manually iterate, or just use normal CRUD functions...
    objs = await query(info.conn, RatingModel).as_list()
    for obj in objs:
        obj.rating += 10
        await save(info.conn, obj).execute()

    # Also, you can create virtual models and use their fields.
    # Because they are defined inside the migration, they are safe from changes in the app.
    @table(skip_registry=True)
    class MigRatingModel(RatingModel):
        @virtual_column
        def inflated(self) -> int:
            return self.rating + 10

        @relation
        def reviewer(self, reviewer: ReviewerModel):
            return self.reviewer_id == reviewer.id

    # Do an update using the fields and relations
    def set_fn(m):
        m.rating = m.inflated()

    def where_fn(m):
        return m.reviewer().email == "some@example.com"

    await update(info.conn, MigRatingModel, set_fn, where_fn).execute()



def migrate():
    return migrations.Migration(
        id="migration_20230426-034718",
        depends_on=[...],
        operations=[
            migrations.RunPython(mig_fn)
        ]
    )
```
