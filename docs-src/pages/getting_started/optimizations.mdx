# Optimizations

The RhubarbExtension will look at returned ObjectSets, UpdateSets, DeleteSets and InsertSets and optimize them based on the current GQL query. If you execute the objectset into a list or object, this optmization cannot occur.

If you are in doubt, try to write fields as non-async functions which will prevent a DB hit outside of the Extension.

```python
@field
async def some_field(...):
    # return an list, not optimized by extension.
    return await query(conn, Model).as_list()


@field
async def some_field(...):
    # return an object, not optimized by extension.
    return await query(conn, Model).one()


@field
def some_field(...):
    # return an objectset, optimized by extension
    return query(conn, Model)


@field
def some_field(...):
    # return an objectset that returns 1 object, optimized by extension
    return query(conn, Model, one=True)


@mutation
async def update_name(...):
    ...
    # This would execute the function and select all field, children queries not optimized.
    return await save(conn, obj).execute()


@mutation
async def update_name(...):
    ...
    # This returns an UpdateSet to Extension, Extension determine what fields to select.
    return save(conn, obj)
```
