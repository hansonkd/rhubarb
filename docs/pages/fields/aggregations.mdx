# Aggregations

Aggregations are done by making a virtual table by setting registry to None and then specifying a `__group_by__`.

Once a `__group_by__` is set on a table, all methods and virtual columns have to be aggregate functions or included in the group by.

Rhubarb will make a subquery and join to do the groupby in order to avoid mixing groupby in your parent query.

```python
from rhubarb import  ModelSelector, BaseModel, column, table, relation, virtual_column
from rhubarb.functions import sum_agg, avg_agg


@table
class Pet(BaseModel):
    name: str = column()
    owner_id: str = column()
    weight_lbs: float = column()


@table(skip_registry=True)
class PetByOwner(Pet):
    @virtual_column
    def avg_weight(self: ModelSelector) -> float:
        return avg_agg(self, self.weight_lbs)

    @virtual_column
    def weight_of_all_lets(self: ModelSelector) -> float:
        return sum_agg(self, self.weight_lbs)

    def __group_by__(self):
        return self.owner_id


@table
class Person(BaseModel):
    name: str = column()

    # Specify relation list of objects. Optimization fence.
    @relation(graphql_type=list[Pet])
    def pets(self, pet: Pet):
        return self.id == pet.owner_id

    @relation
    def pet_stats(self, stats: PetByOwner):
        return self.id == stats.owner_id

    @virtual_column
    def avg_pet_weight(self) -> float:
        return self.pet_stats().avg_weight
```
