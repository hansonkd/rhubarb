# Relations

Rhubarb will follow child selections and inline as many queries for relation data as possible. This means that most relations that return 1 or 0 objects can be inlined in the same Query as their parent object.

## Specify a SQL Reference Constraint

When defining your model, specify a reference to another model's table.

```python
owner_id: uuid.UUID = references(MyModel)
```

You can also do it lazily if the Model is defined after it.

```python
owner_id: uuid.UUID = references(lambda: MyModel)
```

## Relation with One or None objects

By default a relation field computes one or None related objects. you create a relation field by decorating a method that returns a boolean selector.

```python
@table
class Pet:
    owner_id: uuid.UUID = references(Person)

    @relation
    def owner(self: ModelSelector[Pet], owner: Person):
        return self.owner_id == owner.id
```

## Relationships with Many Objects

If you have a parent with many children, you can return a list of children by specifying that you want to return a list using `graphql_type` like so `@relation(graphql_type=list[Pet])`.

Because Rhubarb Aggressively inlines all possible fields into a SQL Query, if you return a `list` from a Relation, there is an optimization fence in which Rhubarb will no longer try to inline the relation. Rhubarb will instead start a new tree and start inlining as many children as possible. This is to avoid exploding cartesian products.

```python
import uuid
from rhubarb import  BaseModel, column, table, relation, references


@table
class Pet(BaseModel):
    name: str = column()
    owner_id: uuid.UUID = references(lambda: Person)

    # Default relation returns a single object
    @relation
    def owner(self, owner: "Person"):
        return self.owner_id == owner.id


@table
class Person(BaseModel):
    name: str = column()

    # Specify relation list of objects. Optimization fence.
    @relation(graphql_type=list[Pet])
    def pets(self, pet: Pet):
        return self.id == pet.owner_id
```
