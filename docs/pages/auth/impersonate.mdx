# Impersonating other Users

When using production, it can be useful to appear logged in as one of your customers.

## Using

The impersonate functions allow superusers to impersonate non-superusers. In order for the impersonate function to work, the superuser must have a current session on the request.

```python
from rhubarb.pkg.users.impersonate import (
    impersonate,
    stop_impersonating,
)


await impersonate(user, info.context["request"])

await stop_impersonating(conn, info.context["request"])
```

## Auditing

Impersonating a user will alter AuditEvent entries by adding an `impersonator_id` to the event. This is the ID of the superuser who is impersonating that user.
