*Strawberry-Rhubarb Pie... Tasty!*

## Rhubarb at a glance

* Asyncio Native
* Build SQL Queries with Python
* Built on GraphQL for optimization layer on nested queries
* Migrations - Automatically generate Schema changes as your data model updates.
* Intuitively Solve N+1 without even realizing it
* Simplify Aggregations / Joins / Subqueries
* Heavily inspired by Django and built with the philosophy of take the best parts.
* Native Public / Private Schema dichotomy
* Pass User and Extra info to use in queries through Strawberry Info's context.
* Doesn't use any other Python ORM for DB access, only Psycopg3

## Extra Rhubarb Features

Rhubarb comes with some extra integrations to make using the ORM easy...

* HTTP - FastAPI / Starlette
* Redis - Rate Limiting / Caching
* Auth - Impersonate / Sessions / Users / WebAuthN / Password
* Security - CORS / CSRF / Field Level Security / Auth Rate Limits
* Auditing - Record all Mutations / Queries / Subscriptions / Custom Events
* Tasks Queue - Chron and one off tasks offloaded to worker processes using arq.

## Automatic SQL Optimizations

Currently, Rhubarb does a few optimizations that cover most uses:

* Selecting only the columns being asked for in the current GQL query
* Inlining joins that don't produce more rows.
* Managing exploding cartesian products from m:n joins
* Pushing Aggregates to Subquery
* Combining aggregates if they use same `GROUP BY`
