# Auditing

Rhubarb comes with built-in Auditing extension that can record all queries, subscriptions, and mutations.

By default, the auditing extension will use a new connection to the database different from the current executing connection of the schema. This is to prevent Transaction rollbacks from deleting written audit events. It also allows you to specify an alternative auditing database (like TimeseriesDB) to silo your events.

The default configuration only logs mutations. This is configurable with `AuditConfig`.


```python
from rhubarb import Schema
from rhubarb.pkg.audit.extensions import AuditingExtension


schema = Schema(
    query=...,
    mutation=...,
    extensions=[
        AuditingExtension,
    ]
)
```

## Builtin Events

Extra events are recorded for login, logout, impersonate, stop_impersonating separately from the GQL mutation when auditing is in (if it is in one).

## Custom Events

You an save custom Audit events with `rhubarb.pkg.audit.models.log_event`

```python
await log_event(event_name="my_custom_event", variables={"wow": 1})


# Passing request will fill in the current user, IP, etc from the request object.
await log_event(request, event_name="my_custom_event", variables={"wow": 1})
```

## Config

By default, audit will use the same DB configuration as your App. You can configure the audit database by specifying an enviornment variable.

`PG_AUDIT_URI` - Connection String that describes a Postgres connection (e.g. `postgres://USER:PASSWORD@HOST:PORT/DATABASE`)

```python
@dataclasses.dataclass(frozen=True)
class AuditConfig:
    audit_mutations: bool = True
    audit_queries: bool = False
    audit_subscriptions: bool = False
    reuse_conn: bool = False
    postgres: PostgresConfig = dataclasses.field(
        default_factory=lambda: load_postgres_config("PG_AUDIT_URI")
    )
```
